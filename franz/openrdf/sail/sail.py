# * A Sesame repository that contains RDF data that can be queried and updated.
# * Access to the repository can be acquired by opening a connection to it.
# * This connection can then be used to query and/or update the contents of the
# * repository. Depending on the implementation of the repository, it may or may
# * not support multiple concurrent connections.
# * <p>
# * Please note that a repository needs to be initialized before it can be used
# * and that it should be shut down before it is discarded/garbage collected.
# * Forgetting the latter can result in loss of data (depending on the Repository
# * implementation)!
