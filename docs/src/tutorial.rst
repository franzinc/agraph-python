The general AllegroGraph documentation is 
`Here <https://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/current/index.html>`_.

This is an introduction to the Python client API to the Python
Application Programmer's Interface (API) to Franz Inc.'s
`AllegroGraph`_.

The Python client tutorial rests on a simple architecture consisting
of the following components:

   - An AllegroGraph server
   - A Python interpreter
   - The AllegroGraph Python API package which allows Python to
     communicate with an AllegroGraph server over HTTP or HTTPS.
   - This document - containing example code that can be pasted
     into the interpreter.
