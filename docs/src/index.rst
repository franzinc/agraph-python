Welcome to AllegroGraph Python client's documentation!
======================================================

The AllegroGraph Python API offers convenient and efficient access to an
AllegroGraph server from a Python-based application. This API provides methods
for creating, querying and maintaining RDF data, and for managing the stored
triples.

The AllegroGraph Python API deliberately emulates the Eclipse RDF4J (formerly
Aduna Sesame) API to make it easier to migrate from RDF4J to AllegroGraph. The
AllegroGraph Python API has also been extended in ways that make it easier and
more intuitive than the RDF4J API.
